<p>Hi! My name is Helen. I am currently a master student major in Electrical Engineering. Technology is fun! I love coding and solving problems. As we all know, practice is the key to master things. This blog is for keeping track of my learning & practice paths. If you have problems or suggestions, feel free to contact me!</p>

<p>Secret: I adopt a cat recently, her name is Riza!</p>
